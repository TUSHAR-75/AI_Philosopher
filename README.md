This project is part of my final year BTech IT work.
The goal of AI Philosopher is to simulate philosophical conversations using basic NLP and later deep learning models.

I started with rule-based logic to understand how AI systems work internally before moving to advanced models.

#Human–AI Interaction (HCI)

Stages durning development:

STAGE 1: Early stage , Rule (Logic) based AI
STAGE 2: Machine Learning , DL,NLP
Uses pre-trained deep learning language model based on transformer architecture
The project uses a hybrid AI approach. Rule-based systems handle safety and intent abstraction, while a pre-trained deep learning language model generates philosophical responses. This separation ensures both explainability and flexibility.

STAGE 3:
